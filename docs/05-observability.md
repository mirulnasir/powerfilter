## Observability & Testing

### Sentry

- For this project, I've used Sentry to track errors and performance. also it's free. Otherwise I would use Datadog.
- ![Sentry Dashboard](obs-1.png)
- home path is doing decent.

### Basic lighthouse report

- ![Lighthouse Report](obs-2.png)
- not really a good report, but it's a good starting point.

### Analytics

- User tracking can be done with analytics util, we can use this module so that we can use multiple different analytics providers.
- And further tracking can be done with `useAnalytics` hook.
