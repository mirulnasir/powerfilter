## List of missing features

### Features

- [ ] Detailed filter attribute, at the moment, we're only filtering attribute for products.
- [ ] Some of filtering requires specific field type, e.g. date, number, etc.
- [ ] Better tooltip
- [ ] Further url sanitisations, basically right now if the attributes has `:`, it's going to be a problem.

### Tools

- [ ] CICD Deploy pipeline
- [ ] Github PR , Issue template
- [ ] React query key builder instead of hardcoding the key.
- [ ] Docker development environment, because as a remote developer, local machine environment can be tricky and can cause issues.
- [ ] Simplify the search params class, it's a bit messy.
